# Market Sizing: TAM, SAM, SOM

## Overview

```
TAM (Total Addressable Market)
 └── SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)
      └── SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)
```

Market sizing answers: "How big is the opportunity?"

Use realistic estimates. Never use aspirational numbers.

---

## TAM - Total Addressable Market

The entire revenue opportunity if you captured 100% of the market.

**What it represents**: Maximum theoretical market size (ceiling, not target).

**Use for**:
- Investor communications
- Long-term strategic planning
- Market attractiveness assessment

---

## SAM - Serviceable Addressable Market

The portion of TAM your product can realistically serve.

**Apply these filters**:

| Filter | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| Geographic reach | Where you can operate |
| Product limitations | Segments you actually serve |
| Distribution constraints | How you reach customers |
| Pricing alignment | Segments that can afford you |

**Example**:
- TAM: All businesses needing CRM ($80B globally)
- SAM: SMBs in North America needing cloud CRM ($8B)

---

## SOM - Serviceable Obtainable Market

What you can realistically capture in the near term.

```
SOM = SAM × Realistic Market Share Percentage
```

**Factors affecting SOM**:
- Competitive intensity
- Brand awareness
- Sales capacity
- Go-to-market resources
- Time in market

**Typical SOM percentages**:

| Market Position | Share Range |
|-----------------|-------------|
| New entrant in competitive market | 1-5% |
| Differentiated product | 5-10% |
| Market leader | 20-40% |

## Calculation Methods

### Top-Down Approach

Start with industry data, apply relevant percentages.

```
TAM = Industry Revenue × Relevant Segment %
SAM = TAM × Geographic % × Product Fit %
SOM = SAM × Realistic Share %
```

**Example**:
```
TAM: Global project management software = $6B
SAM: North America × SMB segment = $6B × 40% × 30% = $720M
SOM: Year 1 realistic capture = $720M × 2% = $14.4M
```

| Attribute | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Pros | Quick, uses existing research |
| Cons | Can miss nuances, garbage-in-garbage-out |

### Bottom-Up Approach

Count potential customers, multiply by revenue per customer.

```
TAM = # Potential Customers × Average Revenue Per Customer
```

**Example**:
```
# of SMBs in target segment: 2M businesses
% that need this solution: 40% = 800K businesses
Average annual contract: $1,200
TAM = 800K × $1,200 = $960M
```

| Attribute | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Pros | More grounded, forces specific assumptions |
| Cons | Harder to gather data, can undercount |

### Value Theory Approach

Estimate value delivered and reasonable value capture.

```
TAM = Total Value Created × Reasonable Capture Rate
```

**Example**:
```
Time saved per user per week: 2 hours
Value of time: $50/hour
Users in market: 10M
Total value: 10M × 2 × $50 × 52 = $52B
Reasonable capture: 5% = $2.6B TAM
```

## Market Opportunity Scoring

### Opportunity Score Formula

```
Opportunity Score = Importance + (Importance - Satisfaction)
```

| Importance | Satisfaction | Score | Interpretation |
|------------|--------------|-------|----------------|
| 10 | 2 | 18 | High opportunity |
| 10 | 8 | 12 | Low opportunity (well-served) |
| 4 | 2 | 6 | Low opportunity (not important) |

**High importance + Low satisfaction = High opportunity**

### Market Attractiveness Criteria

Rate each factor 1-5:

| Factor | Question |
|--------|----------|
| Size | Is the market large enough to support goals? |
| Growth | Is the market growing, stable, or declining? |
| Profitability | What are typical margins? |
| Competition | How intense? Any gaps? |
| Barriers | What protects or prevents entry? |
| Cyclicality | Is demand stable or variable? |

### Red Flags in Market Sizing

| Red Flag | Issue |
|----------|-------|
| Unfiltered TAM from industry reports | Overstates addressable opportunity |
| Significant year 1 share capture | Unrealistic without evidence |
| No competitive response modeling | Ignores market dynamics |
| Ignoring non-consumption | Non-purchase is a competitor |
| Global numbers for local operations | Geographic mismatch |
| Conflating revenue with profit | Margin matters for viability |
